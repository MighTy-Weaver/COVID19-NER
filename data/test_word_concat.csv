The use of nanoparticles in vaccinology is inspired by the fact that most pathogens have a dimension within the nano-size range and therefore can be processed efficiently by the immune system , which leads to a potent immune response . Herein , we report a facile approach to increase antigen size to achieve not only fast but also effective responses against the recombinant HA/ H7N9 protein via a simple conjugation of the protein onto the surface of nanodiamond",

This epidemic had caused 185 laboratory-confirmed cases and 36 deaths in the Republic of Korea until September 2 , 2015 , which attracted public ’ s attention . Based on the detailed data of patients released by World Health Organization ( WHO ) and actual propagation of the epidemic , we construct two dynamical models to simulate the propagation processes from May 20 to June 8 and from June 9 to July 10 , 2015 , respectively and find that the basic reproduction number R ( 0 )",
43,"Advances in Directly Amplifying Nucleic Acids from Complex Samples Advances in nucleic acid amplification technologies have revolutionized diagnostics for systemic , inherited , and infectious diseases . Current assays and platforms , however , often require lengthy experimental procedures and multiple instruments to remove contaminants and inhibitors from clinically-relevant , complex samples . This requirement of sample preparation has been a bottleneck for using nucleic acid amplification tests ( NAATs ) at the point of care ( POC ) , though advances in “ lab-on-chip ” platforms that integrate sample preparation and NAATs have made great strides in this space . Alternatively , direct NAATs —techniques that minimize or even bypass sample preparation—present promising strategies for developing POC diagnostic tools for analyzing real-world samples . In this review",

Inhibitory signaling dampens the immune response , which prevents inflammatory damage to the host . It has now become increasingly clear that viruses have evolved means of exploiting the inhibitory signaling pathways of the immune system in order to blunt the responses that would otherwise abrogate infection . Recent evidence demonstrates how viruses exploit inhibitory receptors both for host cell entry and to down-regulate antiviral responses for enhanced viral pathogenesis . Both acute and chronic viral infections also induce expression of intermediates of inhibitory signaling for improved odds of survival within the",

Here , we demonstrate that CCHFV nucleocapsid protein ( CCHFV-NP ) augments mRNA translation . CCHFV-NP binds to the viral mRNA 5′ untranslated region ( UTR ) with high affinity . It facilitates the translation of reporter mRNA both in vivo and in vitro with the assistance of the viral mRNA 5′ UTR . CCHFV-NP equally favors the translation of both capped and uncapped mRNAs , demonstrating the independence of this translation strategy on the 5′ cap . Unlike the canonical host translation machinery , inhibition of eIF4F complex , an amalgam of",
209,"Structural characterization of recombinant IAV polymerase reveals a stable complex between viral PA- PB1 heterodimer and host RanBP5 The genome of influenza A virus ( IAV ) comprises eight RNA segments ( vRNA ) which are transcribed and replicated by the heterotrimeric IAV RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase ( RdRp ) . RdRp consists of three subunits ( PA , PB1 and PB2 ) and binds both the highly conserved 3 ′- and 5′-ends of the vRNA segment . The IAV RdRp is an important antiviral target , but its structural mechanism has remained largely elusive to date . By applying a polyprotein strategy , we produced RdRp complexes and define a minimal human IAV RdRp core complex . We show that PA-PB1 forms a stable heterodimeric submodule that can strongly",

Here we show that the sugar-binding domains in influenza virus hemagglutinin and other viral lectins share the same structural fold as human galectins ( host lectins ) . Unlike the easily accessible sugar-binding sites in human galectins , the sugar-binding sites in viral lectins are hidden in cavities .

242,"Cats are not small dogs : is there an immunological explanation for why cats are less affected by arthropod -borne disease than dogs ? It is widely recognized that cats appear to be less frequently affected by arthropod -borne infectious diseases than dogs and share fewer zoonotic pathogens with man . This impression is supported by the relative lack of scientific publications related to feline vector-borne infections . This review explores the possible reasons for the difference between the two most common small companion animal species , including the hypothesis that cats might have a genetically-determined immunological resistance to arthropod vectors or the microparasites they transmit . A number of simple possibilities might account for the lower prevalence of these diseases in cats , including factors related to",

To address these issues , we applied the murine model of P0 ( 106–125 ) -induced experimental autoimmune neuritis . Immunization of C57BL/6 mice with P0 ( 106–125 ) resulted in severe axonal damage and mild demyelination . Importantly , these",

Alarmingly , the virus demonstrates the capability of human -to- human transmission , raising the possibility of global spread and endangering world health and economy . Here we have identified the receptor-binding domain ( RBD ) from the MERS-CoV spike protein and determined its crystal structure . This study also presents a structural comparison of MERS-CoV RBD with other coronavirus RBDs , successfully positioning MERS-CoV on the landscape of coronavirus evolution and providing insights into receptor binding by MERS-CoV . Furthermore , we found that MERS-CoV",
249,"Identification of Aim2 as a sensor for DNA vaccines ( ) Recent human study data has re-established the value of DNA vaccines , especially in priming high-level antigen -specific antibody responses , but also raised questions about the mechanisms responsible for such effects . Whereas previous reports have shown involvement of downstream signaling molecules in the innate immune system , the current study investigated the role of Aim2 as a sensor for DNA vaccines . The Aim2 inflammasome directs maturation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 β and IL-18 and an inflammatory form of cell death called pyroptosis . Both the humoral and cellular antigen -specific adaptive responses were significantly reduced in Aim2 ( −/− ) mice in an IL-1 β/ IL-18 independent manner after DNA vaccination . Surprisingly",

These relationships are hypothesized to reflect the causal impact of seasonal environmental factors . However , recent work casts doubt on this interpretation by showing that mothers with lower socioeconomic status are more likely to give birth in months that are associated with poorer birth outcomes . Seasonality in the numbers of conceptions in different months can also induce a mechanical correlation between preterm birth and month of birth . This paper analyzes the seasonality of health at birth using a large sample of 647 ,050 groups of US siblings representing 1 , 435 , 213 children . By following the same",

Neutrophils can reach the perivascular spaces of brain vessels after crossing the endothelial cell layer and endothelial basal lamina of post-capillary venules , or migrating from the leptomeninges following pial vessel extravasation and/or a suggested translocation from the skull bone marrow . Based on previous observations of microglia phagocytosing neutrophils recruited to the ischemic brain lesion , we hypothesized that microglial cells might control neutrophil accumulation in the injured brain . We studied",

When the outer surface of an FFR becomes contaminated , it presents a contact transmission risk to the wearer . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) guidance recommends that healthcare workers ( HCWs ) doff FFRs by grasping the straps at the back of the head to avoid contact with the potentially contaminated surface . Adherence to proper doffing technique is reportedly low due to numerous factors including difficulty in locating and grasping the straps . This study",

Viroporins participate in multiple steps of the viral life cycle , from entry to budding . As any other membrane protein , viroporins have to find the way to bury their hydrophobic regions into the lipid bilayer . Once within the membrane , the hydrophobic helices of viroporins interact with each other to form higher ordered structures required to correctly perform their porating activities . This two -step process resembles the two -stage model proposed for membrane protein folding by Engelman and Poppot . In this review we use the membrane protein folding model as",

431,"Homology-Based Identification of a Mutation in the Coronavirus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase That Confers Resistance to Multiple Mutagens Positive-sense RNA viruses encode RNA -dependent RNA polymerases ( RdRps ) essential for genomic replication . With the exception of the large nidoviruses , such as coronaviruses ( CoVs ) , RNA viruses lack proofreading and thus are dependent on RdRps to control nucleotide selectivity and fidelity . CoVs encode a proofreading exonuclease in nonstructural protein 14 ( nsp14-ExoN ) , which confers a greater-than-10- fold increase in fidelity compared to other RNA viruses . It is unknown to what extent the CoV polymerase ( nsp12-RdRp ) participates in replication fidelity . We sought to determine whether homology modeling could identify putative determinants of nucleotide selectivity and fidelity in CoV RdRps",

465,"Human ribosomal protein L13a is dispensable for canonical ribosome function but indispensable for efficient rRNA methylation Previously , we demonstrated that treatment of monocytic cells with IFN -γ causes release of ribosomal protein L13a from the 60S ribosome and subsequent translational silencing of Ceruloplasmin ( Cp ) mRNA . Here , evidence using cultured cells demonstrates that Cp mRNA silencing is dependent on L13a and that L13a -deficient ribosomes are competent for global translational activity . Human monocytic U937 cells were stably transfected with two different shRNA sequences for L13a and clonally selected for more than 98 % abrogation of total L13a expression . Metabolic labeling of these cells showed rescue of Cp translation from the IFN-γ mediated translational silencing activity . Depletion of L13a caused significant reduction",

Despite this , the basis for the disease progression is incompletely understood . To investigate the effect of co- infection on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells ( MDDCs ) we analysed the expression of clinically important pro-inflammatory and immune-modulatory cytokines . IAV infection or treatment with supernatants from IAV-infected cell cultures resulted in priming of the DCs which subsequently influenced the production of IL-12p70 , as well as IL-6 , following SP infection .

The infiltration of immune cells in the central nervous system is a common hallmark in different neuroinflammatory conditions . Accumulating evidence indicates that resident glial cells can establish a cross-talk with infiltrated immune cells , including T-cells , regulating their recruitment , activation and function within the CNS . Although the healthy CNS has been thought to be devoid of professional dendritic cells ( DCs ) , numerous studies have reported the presence of a population of DCs in specific locations such as the meninges , choroid plexuses and the perivascular space .

Such particles possess the tropism of the virus from which the GP was derived . For example , to exploit the natural neural tropism of rabies virus , vectors designed to target the central nervous system have been pseudotyped using rabies virus -derived GPs . Among the first and still most widely used GPs for pseudotyping lentiviral vectors is the vesicular stomatitis virus GP ( VSV-G ) , due to the very broad tropism and stability of the resulting pseudotypes .",

583,Influence of the stacking potential of the base 3 ' of tandem shift codons on -1 ribosomal frameshifting used for gene expression . Translating ribosomes can shift reading frame at specific sites with high efficiency for gene expression purposes . The most common type of shift to the -1 frame involves a tandem realignment of two anticodons from pairing with mRNA sequence of the form X XXY YYZ to XXX YYY Z where the spaces indicate the reading frame . The predominant -1 shift site of this type in eubacteria is A AAA AAG . The present work shows that in Escherichia coli the identity of the 6 nt 3 ' of this sequence can be responsible for a 14-fold variation in frameshift frequency . The first 3,

This simple approach dramatically saves the computational cost , but sometimes fails to describe a feasible conformational change due to unrealistically excessive spring connections . To overcome this limitation , we propose a mass-weighted chemical elastic network model ( MWCENM ) in which the total mass of each residue is assumed to be concentrated on the representative alpha carbon atom and various stiffness values are precisely assigned according to the types of chemical interactions . We test MWCENM on several well-known proteins of which",

Contrary to what is observed for proteins with a KDEL or a KKXX ER-targeting signal , the ER localization of the HCV glycoprotein complex is due to a static retention in this compartment rather than to its retrieval from the cis-Golgi region . A static retention in the ER is also observed when E2 is expressed in the absence of E1 or for a chimeric protein containing the ectodomain of CD4 in fusion with the transmembrane domain (",

The products of these ISGs exert numerous antiviral effector functions , many of which are still not fully described . Recent efforts have been aimed at identifying which ISGs are antiviral and further characterizing their mechanisms of action . IFN effectors vary widely in their magnitude of inhibitory activity and display combinatorial antiviral properties . Collectively , ISGs can target almost any step in a virus life cycle . Some of the most potent antiviral effectors reinforce the system by further inducing IFN or ISGs . Other genes enhance or facilitate viral replication ,",

However , utilization of modified unstable antigens may be insufficient for potent T- cell cross-presentation by APCs , a mechanism that requires high levels of the antigenic protein . Therefore , we hypothesized that a recombinant vaccine utilizing a combination of proteosome -sensitive and proteosome - resistant versions of an antigen in a prime/boost regimen may provide the most efficient CTL response . To address this hypothesis , we utilized conserved proteosome - resistant influenza A virus proteins M1 and NS1 . Unstable versions of these polypeptides were constructed by destroying",

However , the impact of platelets on HIV-1 infection of T cells is unclear . RESULTS : We found that platelets suppress HIV-1 spread in co-cultured T cells in a concentration-dependent manner . Platelets containing granules inhibited HIV-1 spread in T cells more efficiently than degranulated platelets , indicating that the granule content might exert antiviral activity . Indeed , supernatants from activated and thus degranulated platelets suppressed HIV-1 infection . Infection was inhibited at the stage of host cell entry and inhibition was independent of the viral strain or coreceptor tropism",

Here we reveal that translation occurs through successive translocation -and-pause cycles . The distribution of pause lengths , with a median of 2.8 s , indicates that at least two rate-determining processes control each pause . Each translocation step measures three bases — one codon—and occurs in less than 0.1 s. Analysis of the times required for translocation reveals , surprisingly , that there are three substeps in each step . Pause lengths , and thus the overall rate of translation , depend on the secondary structure of the mRNA ; the applied force destabilizes secondary structure and",

The Toll-like Receptor 4 ( TLR4 ) is the prototypical sensor of infection or injury that orchestrates the innate response via sequential activation of both cell-surface and endocytic signaling pathways that trigger distinct downstream consequences . CD14 binds and delivers LPS to TLR4 and has been identified as a positive regulator of TLR4 signal transduction . It is logical that negative regulators of this process also exist to maintain the critical balance required for fighting infection , healing damaged tissue and resolving inflammation . We showed that CD13 negatively modulates receptor-mediated Ag uptake in dendritic cells to control T- cell activation in adaptive immunity . Here we report that",

762,"Effect of stochasticity on coinfection dynamics of respiratory viruses BACKGROUND : Respiratory viral infections are a leading cause of mortality worldwide . As many as 40 % of patients hospitalized with influenza-like illness are reported to be infected with more than one type of virus . However , it is not clear whether these infections are more severe than single viral infections . Mathematical models can be used to help us understand the dynamics of respiratory viral coinfections and their impact on the severity of the illness . Most models of viral infections use ordinary differential equations ( ODE ) that reproduce the average behavior of the infection , however , they might be inaccurate in predicting certain events because of the stochastic nature of viral replication cycle",

We have used ribosome profiling to characterize viral translation in infected cells and map new translation initiation sites . We show here that EBV transcripts are translated with highly variable efficiency , owing to variable transcription and translation rates , variable ribosome recruitment to the leader region and coverage by monosomes versus polysomes . Some transcripts were hardly translated , others mainly carried monosomes , showed ribosome accumulation in leader regions and most likely represent non-coding RNAs . A similar process was visible for a subset of lytic genes including the key transactivators BZLF1 and BRLF1",

This host shutoff phenotype is orchestrated by the viral SOX protein , yet its functional significance to the viral lifecycle has not been elucidated , in part due to the multifunctional nature of SOX . Using an unbiased mutagenesis screen of the murine gammaherpesvirus 68 ( MHV68 ) SOX homolog , we isolated a single amino acid point mutant that is selectively defective in host shutoff activity . Incorporation of this mutation into MHV68 yielded a virus with significantly reduced capacity for mRNA turnover . Unexpectedly , the MHV68 mutant showed",

We use evolutionary and functional analyses of TfR1 in the rodent clade , where two families of viruses bind this receptor , to mechanistically dissect how essential housekeeping genes like TFR1 successfully balance the opposing selective pressures exerted by host and virus . We find that while the sequence of rodent TfR1 is generally conserved , a small set of TfR1 residue positions has evolved rapidly over the speciation of rodents . Remarkably , all of these residues correspond to the two",

We investigate the asymmetrical interplay between the two types of spreading dynamics , each occurring on its own layer , by focusing on the two fundamental quantities underlying any spreading process : epidemic threshold and the final infection ratio . We find that an epidemic outbreak on the contact layer can induce an outbreak on the communication layer , and information spreading can effectively raise the epidemic threshold . When structural correlation exists between the two layers , the information threshold remains unchanged but the epidemic threshold can be enhanced , making the",

874,"Foot-and-mouth disease virus replicates independently of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and type III phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases Picornaviruses form replication complexes in association with membranes in structures called replication organelles . Common themes to emerge from studies of picornavirus replication are the need for cholesterol and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate ( PI4P ) . In infected cells , type III phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases ( PI4KIIIs ) generate elevated levels of PI4P , which is then exchanged for cholesterol at replication organelles . For the enteroviruses , replication organelles form at Golgi membranes in a process that utilizes PI4KIII β . Other picornaviruses , for example the cardioviruses , are believed to initiate replication at the endoplasmic reticulum and subvert PI4KIII α to generate PI4P . Here we investigated the role of PI4KIII in foot-and-mouth disease",

Since the immune system is hardwired to protect the host , there is a possibility that cancers , regardless of their histological origins , endow themselves with a common and shared inflammatory cancer -associated molecular pattern ( iCAMP ) to promote oncoinflammation . However , the definition of iCAMP has not been conceptually and experimentally investigated . METHODS AND FINDINGS : Genome-wide cDNA expression data was analyzed for 221 normal and 324 cancer specimens from 7 cancer types : breast ,",

The spikes , which are composed of three E2 and E1 glycoprotein heterodimers , are responsible for receptor binding and mediating fusion between the viral and host-cell membranes during entry . In addition , the cytoplasmic domain of E2 interacts with the nucleocapsid core during the last stages of particle assembly , possibly to aid in particle stability . During assembly , the spikes are nonfusogenic until the E3 glycoprotein is cleaved from E2 in the trans-Golgi network . Thus , a mutation in E2 potentially has effects on virus entry , spike assembly , or spike maturation . E2",

The RNA genome of tobacco etch potyvirus ( TEV ) was engineered to express bacterial beta-glucuronidase ( GUS ) fused to the virus helper component proteinase ( HC-Pro ) . It was shown previously that prolonged periods ( approximately 1 month ) of TEV -GUS propagation in plants resulted in the appearance of spontaneous deletion variants . Nine deletion mutants were identified by nucleotide sequence analysis of 40 cDNA clones obtained after polymerase chain reaction amplification . The mutants were missing between 1,741 and 2,074 nucleotides from TEV -GUS , including the sequences coding for most of GUS and the N-terminal region of HC-Pro .

To investigate district-level transmissibility of EVD , we applied a statistical modelling approach to estimate the basic reproduction number ( R ( 0 ) ) for each affected district and each country using weekly incident case numbers . We estimated growth rates during the early exponential phase of the outbreak using exponential regression of the case counts on the first eight weeks since onset . To take into account the heterogeneity between",

This review describes recent findings of how pathogens do it . RECENT FINDINGS : A common theme in interaction between pathogens and host cholesterol metabolism is pathogens targeting lipid rafts of the host plasma membrane . Many intracellular pathogens use rafts as an entry gate , taking advantage of the endocytic machinery and high abundance of outward looking molecules that can be used as receptors . At the same time , disruption of the rafts ’ functional capacity , achieved by",

Because viral RNAs often lack canonical caps or poly-A tails , they can also be vulnerable to degradation by these host exonucleases . Yeast lack sophisticated mechanisms of innate and adaptive immunity , but do use RNA degradation as an antiviral defense mechanism . We find a highly refined , species-specific relationship between Xrn1p and the “ L-A ” totiviruses of different Saccharomyces yeast species . We show that the gene XRN1 has evolved rapidly under positive natural selection in Saccharomyces yeast , resulting in high levels of Xrn1p protein sequence divergence from one yeast species to the next .

1154,"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus NS4b Protein Inhibits Host RNase L Activation Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS-CoV ) is the first highly pathogenic human coronavirus to emerge since severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( SARS - CoV ) in 2002 . Like many coronaviruses , MERS-CoV carries genes that encode multiple accessory proteins that are not required for replication of the genome but are likely involved in pathogenesis . Evasion of host innate immunity through interferon ( IFN ) antagonism is a critical component of viral pathogenesis . The IFN-inducible oligoadenylate synthetase ( OAS ) - RNase L pathway activates upon sensing of viral double-stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) . Activated RNase L cleaves viral and host single-stranded RNA ( ssRNA ) , which leads to",

The frameshift efficiency that is critical for the virus replication , is controlled by an interaction between the ribosome and a specific structure on the viral mRNA , the frameshift stimulatory signal . The rate of cap-dependent translation initiation is known to be altered by the TAR RNA structure , present at the 5′ and 3′ end of all HIV-1 mRNAs . Depending upon its concentration , TAR activates or inhibits the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase ( PKR ) .",
1305,"A camel -derived MERS-CoV with a variant spike protein cleavage site and distinct fusion activation properties Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS-CoV ) continues to circulate in both humans and camels , and the origin and evolution of the virus remain unclear . Here we characterize the spike protein of a camel -derived MERS-CoV ( NRCE-HKU205 ) identified in 2013 , early in the MERS outbreak . NRCE-HKU205 spike protein has a variant cleavage motif with regard to the S2 ′ fusion activation site—notably , a novel substitution of isoleucine for the otherwise invariant serine at the critical P1 ′ cleavage site position . The substitutions resulted in a loss of furin-mediated cleavage , as shown by fluorogenic peptide cleavage and western blot assays . Cell–cell fusion",

In response to anthropogenic changes , including food subsidies , some migratory animals are now migrating shorter distances or halting migration altogether and forming resident populations . Recent studies suggest that shifts in migratory behaviour can alter the risk of infection for wildlife . Although migration is commonly assumed to enhance pathogen spread , for many species , migration has the opposite effect of lowering infection risk , if animals escape from habitats where pathogen stages have accumulated or if strenuous journeys cull infected hosts . Here , we summarize responses of migratory species to supplemental feeding and review modelling and empirical work that",

The most conserved pathway to trigger UPR is initiated by IRE1 . Activation of IRE1 results in auto-phosphorylation , splicing of the XBP1 mRNA and translation of the XBP1s protein . XBP1s binds cis-acting UPR elements ( UPRE ) which leads to the enhanced expression of genes which should restore ER homeostasis . XBP1u protein is translated , if IRE1 is not activated . Here we show",
1536,"Characterization of a novel species of adenovirus from Japanese microbat and role of CXADR as its entry factor Recently , bat adenoviruses ( BtAdVs ) of genus Mastadenovirus have been isolated from various bat species , some of them displaying a wide host range in cell culture . In this study , we isolated two BtAdVs from Japanese wild microbats . While one isolate was classified as Bat mastadenovirus A , the other was phylogenetically independent of other BtAdVs . It was rather related to , but serologically different from , canine adenoviruses . We propose that the latter , isolated from Asian parti-colored bat , should be assigned to a novel species of Bat mastadenovirus . Both isolates replicated in various mammalian cell lines , implying their",

Here , we show that the picornavirus foot-and-mouth disease virus ( FMDV ) induces the formation of autophagosomes . Induction was dependent on Atg5 , involved processing of LC3 to LC3II , and led to a redistribution of LC3 from the cytosol to punctate vesicles indicative of authentic autophagosomes .

Most emerging infections result in dead-end “ spillover ” events in which a pathogen is transmitted from an animal reservoir to a human but is unable to achieve the sustained human-to-human transmission necessary for a full-blown epidemic . It is therefore critical to determine why only some virus infections are efficiently transmitted among humans whereas others are not . We sought to determine which biological features best characterized those viruses that have achieved sustained human transmission . Accordingly , we compiled a database of 203 RNA and DNA human viruses and used an information theoretic approach to assess which of a set",

1664,"A Meta-Analysis of the Association between Gender and Protective Behaviors in Response to Respiratory Epidemics and Pandemics Respiratory infectious disease epidemics and pandemics are recurring events that levy a high cost on individuals and society . The health-protective behavioral response of the public plays an important role in limiting respiratory infectious disease spread . Health-protective behaviors take several forms . Behaviors can be categorized as pharmaceutical ( e.g. , vaccination uptake , antiviral use ) or non-pharmaceutical ( e . g. , hand washing , face mask use , avoidance of public transport ) . Due to the limitations of pharmaceutical interventions during respiratory epidemics and pandemics , public health campaigns aimed at limiting disease spread often emphasize both non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical behavioral interventions .

1749,"Recent advances on the role of host factors during non- poliovirus enteroviral infections Non- polio enteroviruses are emerging viruses known to cause outbreaks of polio -like infections in different parts of the world with several cases already reported in Asia Pacific , Europe and in United States of America . These outbreaks normally result in overstretching of health facilities as well as death in children under the age of five . Most of these infections are usually self-limiting except for the neurological complications associated with human enterovirus A 71 ( EV-A71 ) . The infection dynamics of these viruses have not been fully understood , with most inferences made from previous studies conducted with poliovirus . Non- poliovirus enteroviral infections are responsible for major outbreaks of hand ,",

However , members of this family recognize different cellular receptors and exploit different entry routes , what affects their species specificity and virulence . The aim of this study was to determine how human coronavirus OC43 enters the susceptible cell . Using confocal microscopy and molecular biology tools we visualized early events during infection . We found that the virus employs caveolin-1 dependent endocytosis for the entry and the scission of virus-containing vesicles from the cell surface is dynamin -dependent . Furthermore , the vesicle internalization process requires actin cytoskeleton rearrangements . With our research we strove to broaden",

1785,"Endothelial Targeting of Cowpea Mosaic Virus ( CPMV ) via Surface Vimentin Cowpea mosaic virus ( CPMV ) is a plant comovirus in the picornavirus superfamily , and is used for a wide variety of biomedical and material science applications . Although its replication is restricted to plants , CPMV binds to and enters mammalian cells , including endothelial cells and particularly tumor neovascular endothelium in vivo . This natural capacity has lead to the use of CPMV as a sensor for intravital imaging of vascular development . Binding of CPMV to endothelial cells occurs via interaction with a 54 kD cell-surface protein , but this protein has not previously been identified . Here we identify the CPMV binding protein as a cell-surface form of the intermediate filament",

Because the increased prescriptions of antidepressants are correlated to increased medical visits , it is tempting to conclude , as Hockey did [ 1 ] , that decreased suicides are a function of greater recognition of depression . It should be noted that the biggest cause of suicide is clinical major depression and increased visits do not treat that ; antidepressants do . In a comprehensive review of the literature on the role of long-term antidepressant use to prevent relapse of major depression , Geddes et al .

Viruses are intracellular parasites that ensure their existence by converting host cells into viral particle producing entities or into hiding places rendering the virus invisible to the host immune system . Some viruses may also survive by transforming the infected cell into an immortal tumour cell . MicroRNAs are small non- coding transcripts that function as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression . Viruses encode miRNAs that regulate expression of both cellular and viral genes , and contribute to the pathogenic properties of viruses . Hence , neutralizing the action of viral miRNAs expression by complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides or so-called anti-miRNAs may represent a strategy to combat viral infections and viral-induced pathogenesis . This review describes the miRNAs encoded by",

We have applied serial-thin sectioning and stereology to quantitatively characterize the three -dimensional organization of ER export sites in vivo and in vitro . We find that ER buds in vivo are nonrandomly distributed , being concentrated in regional foci we refer to as export complexes . The basic organization of an export complex can be divided into an active COPII -containing budding zone on a single ER cisterna , which is adjacent to budding zones found on distantly connected ER cisternae . These budding foci surround and face a central cluster of morphologically independent vesicular-tubular elements that contain COPI coats involved in retrograde",

Not surprisingly , viruses have adapted to encode virulence factors to cope with the IFN response . Intriguingly , we show here that all three types of interferons , IFN -α , IFN -γ , and IFN -λ , efficiently promote infection by a human coronavirus , HCoV-OC43 , one of the major etiological agents of common cold , through the induction of IFN-inducible transmembrane ( IFITM ) proteins .

However , co-circulation of many HRV types discouraged further vaccine efforts . We approached this problem straightforwardly . We tested the hypothesis that increasing virus input titers in polyvalent inactivated HRV vaccine will result in broad nAb responses .

More recently , it has become clear that tetherin also acts as a pattern recognition receptor inducing NF-κB-dependent proinflammatory gene expression in virus infected cells . Whereas the ability to restrict virion release is highly conserved among mammalian tetherin orthologs and thus probably an ancient function of this protein , innate sensing seems to be an evolutionarily recent activity .

A general consensus is that all sources of data should be embraced to improve epidemic preparedness . As a disease transmission is inherently governed by individual-level responses , pathogen dynamics within infected hosts posit high potentials to inform population-level phenomena . We propose a multiscale approach showing that individual dynamics were able to reproduce population-level observations . METHODS : Using experimental data , we formulated mathematical models of pathogen infection dynamics from which we simulated mechanistically its transmission parameters . The models were then embedded in our implementation of an age-specific contact network that allows to express individual differences relevant to the transmission",

Studies of defective interfering ( DI ) RNAs of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus ( MHV ) suggest that a 69- nucleotide -long packaging signal is necessary for MHV genomic RNA packaging into MHV particles . In this study we showed that when RNA transcripts that consisted of a non- MHV sequence and the packaging signal were expressed in MHV-infected cells , they were packaged into MHV particles . Those RNA transcripts that lacked the packaging signal or those containing a mutated packaging signal did not package efficiently . Thus , the presence of the packaging signal was sufficient for RNA packaging into MHV particles . _w_pad_ _w_pad_ _w_pad_ _w_pad_ _w_pad_ _w_pad_ _w_pad_ _w_pad_ _w_pad_ _w_pad_ _w_pad_",

While platelet activation and elevated platelet counts ( thrombocytosis ) are associated with increased risk of thrombotic complications , low platelet counts ( thrombocytopenia ) and several platelet function disorders increase the risk of bleeding . Over the last years , more and more evidence has emerged that platelets and their activation state can also modulate innate and adaptive immune responses and low platelet counts have been identified as a surrogate marker for poor prognosis in septic patients . Viral infections often coincide with platelet activation . Host inflammatory responses result in the release of platelet activating mediators and a",

Using Xenopus laevis egg extract , we found that increases in cytosolic calcium lead to the activation of an endogenous ribonuclease , XendoU . A fraction of XendoU localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and is required for nuclear envelope assembly and ER network formation in a catalysis-dependent manner . Using a purified vesicle fusion assay , we show that XendoU functions on the surface of ER membranes to promote RNA cleavage and ribonucleoprotein ( RNP ) removal . Additionally , RNA removal from the surface of vesicles by RNase treatment leads to increased ER network",

As a result , viruses have acquired and evolved genes that antagonize the host antiviral proteins . IFNs inhibit viral infections in part through the 2′,5′- oligoadenylate ( 2-5A ) synthetase ( OAS ) / RNase L pathway . OAS proteins are pathogen recognition receptors that exist at different basal levels in different cell types and that are IFN inducible .

In contrast to other Fc receptors , TRIM21 shows remarkably broad isotype specificity as it does not only bind IgG but also IgM and IgA . When viral pathogens coated with these antibody isotypes enter the cytosol , TRIM21 is rapidly recruited and efficient neutralization occurs before the virus has had the time to replicate",

Here we show that efforts to predict disease emergence commonly conflate fundamentally different evolutionary and epidemiological time scales , and are likely to fail because of the enormous number of unsampled viruses that could conceivably emerge in humans . Although we know much about the patterns and processes of virus evolution on evolutionary time scales as depicted in family-scale phylogenetic trees , these data have little predictive power to reveal the short-term microevolutionary processes that underpin cross-species transmission and emergence .

Indeed , cellular miRNAs target and hybridize to specific sequences of both HTLV-1 and HIV-1 viral transcripts . However , much like the variety of host immune responses to retroviral infection , the virus itself contains mechanisms that assist in the evasion of viral inhibition through control of the cellular RNAi pathway . Retroviruses can hijack both the enzymatic and catalytic components of the RNAi pathway , in some cases to produce novel viral miRNAs that",

2314,"Abstract : The 2019-nCoV outbreak has raised concern of global spread . While person-to-person transmission within the Wuhan district has led to a large outbreak , the transmission potential outside of the region remains unclear . Here we present a simple approach for determining whether the upper limit of the confidence interval for the reproduction number exceeds one for transmission in the United States , which would allow endemic transmission . As of February 7 , 2020 , the number of cases in the United states support subcritical transmission , rather than ongoing transmission . However , this conclusion can change if pre-symptomatic cases resulting from human -to- human transmission have not yet been identified . The 2019-nCoV outbreak is a global health risk , especially considering the",

However , the etiology of most autoimmune diseases remains unknown . Although genetic linkage studies support a critical underlying role for genetics , the geographic distribution of these disorders as well as the low concordance rates in monozygotic twins suggest that a combination of other factors including environmental ones are involved .

Here , we show that the previously reported immune regulator monocyte chemotactic protein-induced protein 1 ( MCPIP1 ) restricts HIV-1 production in CD4+ T cells . While the ectopic expression of MCPIP1 in cell lines abolished the production of HIV-1 , silencing of MCPIP1 enhanced HIV-1 production .

As both cell tropism and tissue tropism of DENV are considered major determinants in the pathogenesis of dengue , there is a critical need for adequate tropism assays , animal models , and human autopsy data . More than 50 years of research on dengue has resulted in a host of literature , which strongly suggests that the pathogenesis of DHF and DSS involves viral virulence factors and detrimental host responses",

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are important early responders during systemic viral infections and , in some cases , the sole producers of IFN α . However , their role in IFNα production during memory responses is unclear . We found that IFNα production is absent during a murine viral memory response despite colocalization of virus and pDCs to the splenic marginal zone .

Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses involved in a variety of pathologies that affect animals and humans . Existing structural models of these viruses propose a helical nucleocapsid under the virion envelope as the unique internal structure . In the present work , we have analyzed the structure of the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus . The definition of its organization supports a new structural model for coronaviruses , since a spherical , probably icosahedral , internal core has been characterized . Disruption of these cores induces the release of N-protein-containing helical nucleocapsids . Immunogold mapping and protein analysis of purified cores showed that they consist of M and N proteins , M being the",

However , the functions and mechanism of 25-HC in HCC remain largely unknown . In this study , we demonstrated that 25-HC promoted HCC cells migration and intrahepatic and extrahepatic metastasis while did not affect the cells proliferation and apoptosis . Mechanistically , the promotive effect of 25-HC was through up-regulation of Toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4 ) dependent fatty acid binding protein 4 ( FABP4 ) . Inhibition of FABP4 hindered 25-HC-induced cells migration and metastasis . Moreover , up-regulation of FABP4 was",

This preclinical study demonstrates the advantage of using the small‐size MIDGE ® DNA vector for improved transgene expression and therapeutic application . This is caused by significant increase in transcription efficiency , but not by increased intracellular vector copy numbers or gene transfer efficiency . We used the MIDGE ‐ hTNF‐alpha vector for high‐level expression of hTNF‐alpha in vitro and in vivo for a combined gene therapy and vindesine treatment in human melanoma models . The MIDGE vector mediated high‐level hTNF‐alpha expression leads to sensitization of melanoma cells towards vindesine . The",

However , the role of other post-translational modifications , such as ADP-ribosylation , in host-virus interactions is less well characterized . ADP -ribosylation is carried out by proteins encoded by the PARP ( also called ARTD ) gene family . The majority of the 17 human PARP genes are poorly characterized . However , one PARP protein , PARP13 / ZAP , has broad antiviral activity and has evolved under positive ( diversifying ) selection in primates . Such evolution is typical of domains that are locked in antagonistic ‘ arms races ’",

However , an innate and unsolved problem regarding the ssRNA genome is formation of inactive double-stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) during replication . Here , we addressed this problem by focusing on the secondary structure . We systematically designed RNAs with various structures and observed dsRNA formation during replication using an RNA replicase ( Qβ replicase ) . From the results , we extracted a simple rule regarding ssRNA genome replication with less dsRNA formation ( less GC number in loops ) and then designed an artificial RNA that",

Recent evidence suggests that IFITMs block virus hemifusion ( lipid mixing in the absence of viral content release ) by altering the properties of cell membranes . Consistent with this mechanism , excess cholesterol in late endosomes of IFITM-expressing cells has been reported to inhibit IAV entry . Here , we examined IAV restriction by IFITM3 protein using direct virus-cell fusion assay and single virus imaging in live cells .

However , development of anti-HAstV therapies is hampered by the gap in knowledge of protective antibody epitopes on the HAstV capsid surface . Here , we report the structure of the HAstV capsid spike domain bound to the neutralizing monoclonal antibody PL-2 . The antibody uses all six complementarity-determining regions to bind to a quaternary epitope",

In inflammation , CD13 is expressed on myeloid cells , is up-regulated on endothelial cells at sites of inflammation and mediates monocyte/endothelial adhesion by homotypic interactions . In animal models the lack of CD13 alters the profiles of infiltrating inflammatory cells at sites of ischaemic injury . Here , we found that CD13 expression is enriched specifically on the pro-inflammatory subset of monocytes , suggesting that CD13 may regulate trafficking and function of specific subsets of immune cells .

A strategy to construct chimeric adenoviruses whereby the rescue and propagation of an E1 deleted HAdV -B – derived adenoviral vector can be achieved using existing cell lines such as HEK 293 is reported . It is further shown that this strategy may be more widely applicable . _w_pad_ _w_pad_ _w_pad_ _w_pad_ _w_pad_ _w_pad_ _w_pad_ _w_pad_ _w_pad_ _w_pad_ _w_pad_",

Here , we demonstrate that the repeating protein subunit pattern common to most virus capsids is a molecular pattern that induces a Toll-like-receptor-2 ( TLR2 ) -dependent antiviral immune response . This early antiviral immune response regulates the clearance of subsequent bacterial superinfections , which are a primary cause of morbidities associated with influenza virus infections . Utilizing this altered susceptibility to subsequent bacterial challenge as an outcome , we determined that multiple unrelated , empty , and replication-deficient capsids",

However , inflammatory stimuli can trigger IFNAR1 ubiquitination and downregulation thereby attenuating IFN effects in vitro . The significance of this paradoxical regulation is unknown . Presented here results demonstrate that inability to stimulate IFNAR1 ubiquitination in the Ifnar1 ( SA ) knock-in mice renders them highly susceptible to numerous inflammatory syndromes including acute and chronic pancreatitis , and autoimmune and toxic hepatitis .

The envelope glycoprotein ( GP ) , responsible for both receptor binding and fusion of the virus envelope with the host cell membrane , has been demonstrated to interact with multiple molecules in order to enhance entry into host cells . Here we have demonstrated that filoviruses utilize glycosaminoglycans , and more specifically heparan sulfate proteoglycans , for their attachment to host cells . This interaction is mediated by GP and does not require the presence of the mucin domain . Both the degree of sulfation and the structure of the carbohydrate backbone play a role in the interaction with filovirus GPs . This new",

Accessory protein 6 is a 63-residue amphipathic peptide that accelerates coronavirus infection kinetics in cell culture and in mice . Protein 6 is minimally bifunctional , with an N-terminal lipophilic part implicated in accelerating viral growth and a C-terminal hydrophilic part interfering with general protein import into the nucleus . This interference with nuclear import requires interaction between protein 6 and cellular karyopherins , a process that typically involves nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) motifs . Here we dissected protein 6 using site-directed mutagenesis and found no evidence for a classical NLS . Furthermore , we",

Here , we show that recombination in betacoronaviruses , including human-infecting viruses like SARS and MERS , frequently encompasses the Receptor Binding Domain ( RBD ) in the Spike gene . We find that this common process likely led to a recombination event at least 11 years ago in an ancestor of the 2019-nCoV involving the RBD . Compared with bat isolates , the recent ancestors of 2019-nCoV accumulated a high number of amino acid substitutions in the RBD and likewise",

The corresponding genomic region is of particular interest , as it harbors more disease associations than any other region in the human genome , including associations with infectious diseases , autoimmune disorders , cancers , and neuropsychiatric diseases . Certain MHC molecules can bind to a much wider range of epitopes than others , but the functional implication of such an elevated epitope -binding repertoire has remained largely unclear . It has been suggested that by recognizing more peptide segments ,",

In the absence of appropriate external data sources , to correctly describe the disease propagation , we explore a flexible approach , based on stochastic models for the disease dynamics , and on diffusion processes for the parameter dynamics . Using such a diffusion process has the advantage of not requiring a specific mathematical function for the parameter dynamics . Coupled with particle MCMC , this approach allows us to reconstruct the time evolution",

In this study , to identify high-confidence candidate genes of MD genetic resistance , high throughput sequencing ( RNA-seq ) was used to obtain transcriptomic data of CD4 ( + ) T cells isolated from MDV -infected and non-infected groups of two reciprocal crosses of individuals mating by two",
2934,"MERS coronaviruses from camels in Africa exhibit region-dependent genetic diversity Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS-CoV ) causes a zoonotic respiratory disease of global public health concern , and dromedary camels are the only proven source of zoonotic infection . Although MERS-CoV infection is ubiquitous in dromedaries across Africa as well as in the Arabian Peninsula , zoonotic disease appears confined to the Arabian Peninsula . MERS-CoVs from Africa have hitherto been poorly studied . We genetically and phenotypically characterized MERS-CoV from dromedaries sampled in Morocco , Burkina Faso , Nigeria , and Ethiopia . Viruses from Africa ( clade C ) are phylogenetically distinct from contemporary viruses from the Arabian Peninsula ( clades A and B ) but remain antigenically similar in microneutralization tests .

2936,"Interferon -λ : immune functions at barrier surfaces and beyond When type III interferon ( IFN -λ ; also known as interleukin -28 ( IL-28 ) and IL-29 ) was discovered in 2003 , its antiviral function was expected to be analogous to the type I IFNs ( IFN -α and IFN -β ) , via the induction of IFN-stimulated genes ( ISGs ) . While IFN -λ stimulates expression of antiviral ISGs preferentially in cells of epithelial origin , recent studies have defined additional antiviral mechanisms in other cell types and tissues . Models of viral infection using mice lacking IFN-λ signaling and single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) associations with human disease have expanded our understanding of the contribution of IFN -λ to the antiviral response",
2937,"Development and Assessment of a Diagnostic DNA Oligonucleotide Microarray for Detection and Typing of Meningitis -Associated Bacterial Species Meningitis is commonly caused by infection with a variety of bacterial or viral pathogens . Acute bacterial meningitis ( ABM ) can cause severe disease , which can progress rapidly to a critical life-threatening condition . Rapid diagnosis of ABM is critical , as this is most commonly associated with severe sequelae with associated high mortality and morbidity rates compared to viral meningitis , which is less severe and self-limiting . We have designed a microarray for detection and diagnosis of ABM . This has been validated using randomly amplified DNA targets ( RADT ) , comparing buffers with or without formamide , in glass slide format or on the",
2938,"Emerging and Zoonotic Infections in Women Emerging infections , many of them zoonotic , are caused by a wide variety of pathogens with global distribution . Their impact on women is similarly diverse . Pathogens that were previously rare are emerging in recent years to cause disease in new populations , and global travel facilitates their rapid spread across continents . Finally , human encroachment on previously remote areas has brought people into contact with zoonotic diseases and vectors never before characterized . Although systematic study of rare outbreaks can be challenging , our knowledge of emerging pathogens and their differential effects on women , including those who are pregnant , has started to accumulate . We discuss the effects on women of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus , West",

Strategies for the rapid and reliable analysis of microorganisms have been sought to meet national needs in defense , homeland security , space exploration , food and water safety , and clinical diagnosis . Mass spectrometry has long been a candidate technique because it is extremely rapid and can provide highly specific information . It has excellent sensitivity . Molecular and fragment ion masses provide detailed fingerprints , which can also be interpreted . Mass spectrometry is also a broad band method—everything has a mass—and it is automatable . Mass spectrometry is a physiochemical method that is orthogonal and complementary to biochemical and morphological methods used to characterize microorganisms . _w_pad_ _w_pad_ _w_pad_",

2947,"Effects of topical capsaicin in seasonal allergic rhinitis . BACKGROUND -- Mucosal exudation ( luminal entry ) of bulk plasma is a key feature of airway defence and inflammation . In guinea pig and rat airways this response is readily produced by neurogenic irritants , notably capsaicin . Thus `` neurogenic airway inflammation '' has become an established concept . The present study examines whether capsaicin also produces mucosal exudation of plasma in human nasal airways both in health and disease ( seasonal allergic rhinitis ) . METHODS -- Pain -producing concentrations of capsaicin ( 30-300 ng/ml ) were applied to the nasal mucosal surface both before and late into the pollen season . Levels of albumin in nasal lavage fluid were measured as an index of mucosal",
